# terraform-fmt-check action

This is one of a suite of terraform related actions - find them at [dflook/terraform-github-actions](https://github.com/dflook/terraform-github-actions).

This action uses the `terraform fmt` command to check that all terraform files in a terraform configuration directory are in the canonical format.
This can be used to check that files are properly formatted before merging.

If any files are not correctly formatted a failing GitHub check will be added for the file, and the job failed.

## Inputs

* `path`

  Path to the terraform configuration

  - Type: string
  - Optional
  - Default: The action workspace

## Example usage

This example workflow runs on every push and fails if any of the
terraform files are not formatted correctly.

```yaml
name: Check terraform file format

on: [push]

jobs:
  check_format:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: Check terraform file are formatted correctly
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: terraform fmt
        uses: dflook/terraform-fmt-check@v1
        with:
          path: my-terraform-config
```
